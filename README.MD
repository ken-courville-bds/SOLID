# SOLID

> A repository for practicing and demonstrating SOLID OO principles


## The Principles Summary

* S: Single responsibility principle (SRP). A class should do one thing.
* O: Open closed principle (OCP). Opened to extension, closed to modification.
* L: Liskov Substitution principle (LSP). How polymorphism should work.
* I: Interface segregation Principle (ISP). How interface should be designed.
* D: Dependency inversion principle (DIP). Describes principle between abstraction and concrete types.

## Calculator Library

The Calculator Library demonstrates SOLID principles without introducing an overly complex 
application.

### Requirements

Provide a shared library that can perform these mathamatical operations against provided numbers.
For now, all number parameters and results must be of type `double`. The library must follow
SOLID principles and be maintainable.

1. Add: a + b = ?
2. Substract: a - b = ?
3. Multiple: a * b = ?
4. Devide: a / b = ?
5. Power: a ^ b = ?
